# Changelog

All notable changes to Accretion are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Updated the Python, frontend, and GitHub Actions toolchains to their current
  compatible releases.
- Reworked UI project defaults and event-stream state to comply with the current
  React Hooks correctness rules without duplicating query-backed state.

### Security

- Updated pytest to 9.1.1, resolving CVE-2025-71176 in development test runs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Provider-neutral Codex and Claude runtime control with normalized durable events.
- Deterministic task profiling and static DIRECT/LOOP/GRAPH/HYBRID selection.
- Bounded verifier-gated loops, validated workflow templates, checkpoints, replay,
  approvals, and isolated Git worktrees.
- Governed capability/MCP boundary, credential broker, and idempotent side-effect
  evidence.
- Complete React operator surfaces with snapshot-first resumable SSE.
- Reproducible 30-task ACR-ARCH benchmark and balanced live provider calibration.

### Security

- Deny-by-default external capability policy and task-scoped provider tool exposure.
- Credential values excluded from model context and serialized API/event payloads.
- Durable side-effect intent is recorded before execution and terminal result after.
